/**

 * returned by {@code TimesheetIntegration}. Mirrors what the TMS exposes,
 * defined locally so Epic 2 never depends on TMS's internal DTOs.
 *
 * {@code hourlyRate} is populated by the Strategy from the Billing
 * Configuration (Epic 1), not by the TMS integration — TMS owns
 * operational data only, never commercial data.
 *
 * {@code workDate} and {@code role} come from TMS and are carried through
 * for UI display and ROLE_BASED rate resolution respectively.
 * {@code approvalStatus} is carried for UI display ("Approval Status" column).
